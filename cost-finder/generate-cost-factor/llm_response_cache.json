      "reasoningAndMethodology": "No Australia-specific price was provided in the search results. I used the six regional USD/kg observations from the two provided sources (IMARC and BusinessAnalytIQ for Northeast Asia, Europe, North America). After verifying there were no extreme outliers, I calculated the central tendency using the median of the six USD/kg observations (0.47, 0.48, 0.51, 0.52, 0.62, 0.64) -> median = (0.51+0.52)/2 = 0.515 USD/kg, rounded to 0.52 USD/kg. Converted USD to AUD using an inferred exchange rate (1 USD = 1.50 AUD) because no FX rate was provided in the search results.",
      "assumptions": "Australia price is not available so a fallback to global/regional market index central tendency is used. FX rate is inferred (1 USD = 1.50 AUD). Rounding applied to two decimals."
